Synopsis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project includes the HDL (Verilog) code to implement a positive and negative edge detector circuit along with the testbench environment to test the working of the resulting circuit in a simulator (here Model Sim).


Code Example
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
```

Motivation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Systematically learning (re-learning) digitial logic design theory along with Verilog/System Verilog coding required to implement logic circuits.


Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
```
Tests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use 'testbench.sv' to instantiate an approprite memory module (e.g. EdgeDetector) to which address and write data can be passed as input to the module and then data from the selected memory location can be read as an output from the module.
